You may contact the Life Resources at the contact listed above to let them know
the billed charges are higher than the Good Faith Estimate. You can ask them to
update the bill to match the Good Faith Estimate, ask to negotiate the bill, or
ask if there is financial assistance available. You may also start a dispute
resolution process with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
If you choose to use the dispute resolution process, you must start the dispute
process within 120 calendar days (about 4 months) of the date on the original
bill. There is a $25 fee to use the dispute process. If the agency reviewing
your dispute agrees with you, you will have to pay the price on this Good Faith
Estimate. If the agency disagrees with you and agrees with the health care
provider or facility, you will have to pay the higher amount.

For questions or more information about your right to a Good Faith Estimate or
the dispute process, visit www.cms.gov/nosurprises or call CMS at
